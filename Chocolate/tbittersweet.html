            <p class="details">Bittersweet chocolate is chocolate liquor (or unsweetened chocolate) to which sugar, more cocoa butter, lecithin, and vanilla has been added. It has less sugar and more liquor than semisweet chocolate, but the two are interchangeable in baking. The best quality about bittersweet and semisweet chocolates are that they are produced as couverture; many brands now print on the package the percentage of cocoa (as chocolate liquor and added cocoa butter) contained. The rule is that the higher the percentage of cocoa, the less sweet the chocolate will be.<br>Bittersweet chocolate is a lightly sweetened eating or baking chocolate that generally contains about 40 percent cocoa butter. For superior quality, look for bittersweet chocolate with at least 50 percent cocoa butter. Store chocolate well wrapped in a cool, dry place for up to 4 months. </p>
