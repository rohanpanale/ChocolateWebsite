            <h2 class="subtop">How is Milk chocolate made?</h2>
            <p class="details">Crafting milk chocolate is a labour of love, with three main stages:<br>First, chocolate producers blend milk ingredients and sugar and gently mix them with chocolate liquor and cocoa powder. The mixture is dried and becomes a milk chocolate crumbly powder.<br>The final stage is where milk chocolate gets its smooth and velvety taste and texture through a stage called ‘conching’, which means carefully mixing all the ingredients together. Like a chef in his own kitchen, the master chocolatiers follow a traditional long conching which guarantees a rich, subtle flavour development. The process starts at a low temperature and as it starts mixing, the temperature is raised very slowly to help it dry, and develop new delicate flavours from the heat.<br>Care is taken to gently mix for long enough to full develop the chocolate flavours, and allow ingredients to combine together in the most silky way possible.</p>

            <h2 class="subtop">Milk Chocolate's Smooth Taste</h2>
            <p class="details">Milk chocolate gets its mild, velvety taste from a delicate balance of ingredients.<br>Whilst milk chocolate and dark chocolate both use cocoa liquor, cocoa butter and sugar, milk chocolate also uses milk powder, to give its creamier taste, texture, and lighter colour.</p>
