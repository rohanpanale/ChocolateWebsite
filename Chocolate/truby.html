            <h1 class="top">What is Ruby Chocolate?</h1>
            <p class="details">In September 2017, scientists at the Swiss chocolate-making company Barry Callebaut announced the discovery of ruby chocolate, the first new chocolate development since Nestlé debuted white chocolate in 1930. According to Barry Callebaut, ruby chocolate is made from “ruby cacao beans,” which are found in Ecuador, Brazil and Ivory Coast. Similar to grapes that are grown for fine wine, the ruby cacao beans are influenced by their environment and thereby cultivated in specific climate conditions.<br>While the chocolate manufacturer has kept the details on how ruby chocolate is produced top secret, they have shared that the candy’s photo-worthy blush color and unique flavor are a result of the ruby cacao bean’s fermentation process.</p>

            <h2 class="subtop">What’s It Taste Like?</h2>
            <p class="details">Despite having no added berries, flavor or coloring, ruby chocolate still tastes pretty fruity. The chocolate boasts a sweet, berry-like flavor with a slightly tart after-note. It’s completely unlike milk or dark chocolate, seeing that it’s not overly milky or bitter.<br>Instead, ruby chocolate blends hints of berry (most notably raspberry and strawberry) with a smooth, decadent texture. If anything, it almost tastes like a rich, berry-flavored white chocolate.</p>

            <h2 class="subtop">The history of ruby chocolate</h2>
            <p class="details">In 2004, Callebaut announced that it had apparently discovered a new type of bean: the “ruby” cocoa bean. However, the company didn’t bring its product to market until well over 10 years later in 2017.<br>At the launch in Shanghai, Peter Boone, Barry Callebaut’s Chief Innovation & Quality Officer explained that ruby chocolate, “satisfies a new consumer need found among Millennials – Hedonistic Indulgence.”<br>So how did ruby chocolate come to be? According to the Callebaut story, “One of [their] cocoa experts discovered that unique components, naturally present in cocoa beans, yield chocolate with an exceptional red-pink colour and fruity taste.”<br>Callebaut claims that ruby chocolate is natural and that the pink colour is not the result of added colouring or berry flavouring. Instead, they say that the color is naturally found in certain cocoa beans from Brazil, Ecuador and the Ivory Coast.</p>

            <h2 class="subtop">How is ruby chocolate different to white chocolate?</h2>
            <p class="details">On a scale from most to least amount of cacao content, ruby chocolate has more cocoa mass than white chocolate. According to Callebaut, ruby chocolate contains 47.3% cocoa solids. Most good quality white chocolate has a cacao content of between 30% to 40%.<br>Another difference between ruby chocolate and white chocolate is that ruby chocolate contains both cocoa butter and cocoa mass. White chocolate only contains the cocoa butter component of the cocoa bean.</p>
