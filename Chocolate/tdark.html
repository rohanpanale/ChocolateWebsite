            <p class="details">Luxurious, bittersweet and always tempting. Dark chocolate is a treat that’s rich in flavour and deep in colour. More intense than milk or white chocolate, dark chocolate is perfect for those who crave exotic, full-bodied flavours.</p>

            <h2 class="subtop">How is Dark chocolate made?</h2>
            <p class="details">Crafting dark chocolate is a precise art. With a higher percentage of cocoa, dark chocolate is carefully blended by chocolate producers to give an intense, rich chocolate taste. Our intense dark chocolate is made with 70% cocoa and sourced from sustainably grown Rainforest Alliance certified cocoa beans, from both Ghana and Tanzania, to give an indulgent blend.<br>A key phase in the preparation is ‘conching’, which is similar to kneading dough. Like a chef in his own kitchen, the master chocolatiers follow a traditional long conching process of mixing two simple ingredients: cocoa and sugar, to guarantee a full flavour development.<br>The process starts at a specific temperature, and as it starts mixing, the temperature is raised very slowly to remove moisture, and develop new flavours from the heat.<br>Care is taken to mix for long enough to fully develop the chocolate flavours, and allow ingredients to combine together in the most silky way possible.<br>Some chocolate producers may add spices for a fiery kick, or vanilla for a touch of smoothness. No matter what flavour is added, dark chocolate always retains its deep hue and intensity.</p>

            <h2 class="subtop">Delight your taste buds with Dark Chocolate</h2>
            <p class="details">It contrasts well with sweet or zingy foods. Dipping strawberries or mango slices in it brings out the sweetness in both.<br>Mixing it with strong roasted coffee can add a flavour sensation to your mid-morning coffee break.</p>
